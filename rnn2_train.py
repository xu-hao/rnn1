'''Sequence to sequence example in Keras (character-level).

This script demonstrates how to implement a basic character-level
sequence-to-sequence model. We apply it to translating
short English sentences into short French sentences,
character-by-character. Note that it is fairly unusual to
do character-level machine translation, as word-level
models are more common in this domain.

# Summary of the algorithm

- We start with input sequences from a domain (e.g. English sentences)
    and correspding target sequences from another domain
    (e.g. French sentences).
- An encoder LSTM turns input sequences to 2 state vectors
    (we keep the last LSTM state and discard the outputs).
- A decoder LSTM is trained to turn the target sequences into
    the same sequence but offset by one timestep in the future,
    a training process called "teacher forcing" in this context.
    Is uses as initial state the state vectors from the encoder.
    Effectively, the decoder learns to generate `targets[t+1...]`
    given `targets[...t]`, conditioned on the input sequence.
- In inference mode, when we want to decode unknown input sequences, we:
    - Encode the input sequence into state vectors
    - Start with a target sequence of size 1
        (just the start-of-sequence character)
    - Feed the state vectors and 1-char target sequence
        to the decoder to produce predictions for the next character
    - Sample the next character using these predictions
        (we simply use argmax).
    - Append the sampled character to the target sequence
    - Repeat until we generate the end-of-sequence character or we
        hit the character limit.
